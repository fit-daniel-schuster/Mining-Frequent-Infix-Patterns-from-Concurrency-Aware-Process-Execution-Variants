### Repository Structure
* The proposed Valid Tree Miner algorithms and the baseline Freqt algorithm are implemented in 
`Scripts/Algos/asai_performance.py` and `Scripts/Algos/valid_performance.py`.
* In `Scripts/run_eval.py` is a script to run the conducted experiments.

### Setup
* A requierments file for the virtual enviroment used to run the experiment is located in 'Scripts/requierments.txt'
* A requierments file for the virtual enviorment used to run the plotting Jupyter Notebook is located in 'Plotting/requierments.txt'

### Experiments

### Further Results

This repository contains additional Figure and the orginal Eval-Runs. 
The results/plots are located in `Plotting/Figure` and the Eval-Runs in 'Plotting/Eval-Runs'.
